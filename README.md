# AI Agent Implementation in Pac-Man game
Implemented search algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*, Minimax) in Python to create an agent for the Pac-Man game. Created a Bayes Net & Hidden Markov Model, adding probabilistic inference features under noisy settings. Added a reinforcement learning agent with Q learning, Neural Net to win the game without known topology.
